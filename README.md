Machine Learning Roman Coinage

This is a project to use Python+TensorFlow to classify Roman Coinage using Online Coins of the Roman Empire (http://numismatics.org/ocre/) as a dataset.

The personal purpose of this project is to develop TensorFlow skills, while hopefully creating a useful analytical tool for numismatists.

Since this project is primarly for my own educational purposes, several requirements are learning-based.

1. Use PEP8 consistently and throughout.
2. Write up project development in blog form (https://curiousalbatross.wordpress.com/), currently in private until there is enough content.
3. Project decisions should be reasoned and clearly described. 
4. Code is to be kept as simple as possible.
5. Detailed, useful comments throughout. Code should be maintainable by others.
6. Project development should be test driven.
7. Have fun!

MLRC Objectives

The primary goal is to take as input a high-resolution photograph of a coin, and return either a direct match or likeliest matches.

Further development can attempt to place a coin within a typological series, where no clear matches exist - chronologically, geographically, politically.
